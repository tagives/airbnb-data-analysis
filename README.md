# Airbnb Data Analysis Project

This is a data analysis project I completed during my first year at METU Statistics Department.  
It focuses on NYC Airbnb data from 2003 to 2022 and uses Tableau for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:
- Neighborhoods and neighborhood groups
- Room types and average prices
- Number of reviews and service fees
- Host verification status
- Construction years and minimum nights

## Tools Used

- **Tableau** (for data cleaning and visualizations)
- **Excel** (for initial preparation)
- 
## Key Questions Explored

- How did average prices change over time across different neighborhood groups?
- Is there a relationship between price and number of reviews?
- How did room type preferences shift during the pandemic?
- What are the differences between verified and unverified hosts?
- How does service fee impact review ratings?
